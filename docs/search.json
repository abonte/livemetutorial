In this couse, only the metada will be uploaded. The actual data are kept on the student device. JKAN is backend-free and the business logic, maintained in the reference Github repository, is developed in node js and is executed directly from the repository as Github pages. Once the reference github repository is set up, the catalog can go online immediately. It is accessible through the link provided by its github webpage. The development and maintenance of the catalog can be done completely on the repository, all the modifications performed there will be directly available online on the webpage. Being based on Github, the JKAN catalog can be updated only by users who have access to the relative repository."

    "text": "3 Repository structure\nIn this section, we describe the structure of the JKAN template repository that Datascientia provides to set up a new catalog. Below we describe the most important elements for the course.\n\n_data : this directory contain the yml configuration files used to define the metadata of the resources handled by the catalog (within the “schemas” directory), as well as the categories that can be used to categorize the resources in the catalogs, and the custom services which can accessed to the catalog.\n_datasets : this directory stores the markdown file describing (following a precise metadata schema) each dataset uploaded in the catalog.\n_organizations : similar to the _datasets directory, this one contains the markdown files defining the organization that have uploaded (the owner usually) datasets in the catalog.\n_config.yml : this is the main config file of the JAKN catalog.\ndatasets.json : this file defines the structure of each dataset that can be searched within the catalog. This file is used for the search functionality mostly, this means that, in order to be searchable, the datasets in the catalog need to respect the structure in this file, which can be updated in order to add new search criteria.\n\nOther folders in the repository:\n\n_includes : this directory contains the website pages (html files) that are shown in the catalog web page.\ncss : it contains the catalog main.css style file.\nimg : it contains the images used in the catalog website.\nscripts : this directory contains the business logic of the JKAN catalog. More in detail, in the “src” subdirectory we can find the javascript code divided in the different files, containing different specific functions. While in the “dist” subdirectory we can find the bundle.js file that is the file created after building the code in the src subdirectory. The bundle.js file is the only file that is actually executed in order to apply the JKAN business logic to the catalog. This means that all the modification performed in the source code (src subdirectory) needs to be reported in the bundle.js file too, this happens automatically running the build process (see the next section for the instruction about how to make a new build locally).\nIndex.html : this is the main html file of the catalog webpage. The visualization of the catalog website, as well as its navigation, starts from this file."
